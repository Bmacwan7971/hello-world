In the Web Design course, I’d like to learn how to create clean, modern, and user-friendly websites from scratch. I want to understand how design choices impact user experience and how to use tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring creative ideas to life. My goal is to build the confidence and skills to design websites that not only look great but also work smoothly across different devices.

 I’d also like to gain both the creative and technical skills needed to build professional, functional websites. I want to learn how to design layouts that are visually appealing and easy to navigate, while also understanding how to write clean code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm especially interested in how color, typography, and structure influence the way users interact with a site. I also want to explore responsive design so that my websites work well on phones, tablets, and desktops. Overall, I hope this course will give me the foundation to eventually build my own personal or business websites and possibly pursue freelance or career opportunities in web design.
